Project Background

The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters, with over 1,500 lives tragically lost. Factors like class, gender, and age have been extensively studied for their influence on survival rates. This project seeks to go beyond these well-known variables by applying k-means clustering to uncover hidden patterns and demographic groupings that may have impacted survival outcomes.

Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to use k-means clustering to segment Titanic passengers based on their demographic features and ticket information. Through this analysis, we aim to:

Identify hidden clusters of passengers and uncover relationships that may have influenced survival.
Analyze the interaction of factors such as age, family size, and fare within each cluster.
Visualize these clusters to better understand patterns and trends in survival rates.
Provide data-driven insights to enhance understanding of the key factors contributing to the passengers' fate.
Outcomes

The analysis yielded several important insights:

Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than second- and third-class passengers, highlighting the impact of socioeconomic status on survival.
Gender and Age: Women and children had a greater likelihood of survival, emphasizing the "women and children first" evacuation protocol during the disaster.
Family Size: Passengers traveling in smaller family groups had better survival outcomes compared to those traveling with larger families.
Clustering and Data Segmentation: The k-means clustering model successfully segmented passengers into distinct groups based on factors such as age, gender, class, and family size. This provided a deeper understanding of survival patterns.
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques like k-means clustering in identifying hidden patterns in historical datasets. The insights derived are valuable not only for historical analysis but also for informing modern-day safety protocols and decision-making in transportation and emergency planning.

Conclusions

The k-means clustering approach successfully segmented Titanic passengers into distinct groups based on their demographic and ticket information. The analysis revealed key trends such as the influence of class, gender, and age on survival rates. While women, children, and first-class passengers had a higher chance of survival, lower-class passengers, particularly men, were more vulnerable.

By applying clustering, we uncovered hidden trends that traditional analysis might have overlooked. This project illustrates the value of machine learning techniques in historical data analysis, offering actionable insights for future policy and safety protocols in mass transportation systems.

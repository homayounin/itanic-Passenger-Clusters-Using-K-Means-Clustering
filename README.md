 Titanic Passenger Clusters Using K-Means Clustering
 Project Background 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters, resulting in the tragic loss of over 1,500 lives. Factors like class, gender, and age are well-known to have influenced survival rates. However, this project seeks to uncover hidden patterns within the data by applying k-means clustering, revealing lesser-known demographic groupings and trends that may have impacted survival outcomes.

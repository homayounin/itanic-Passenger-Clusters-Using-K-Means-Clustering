Project Background 
The sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous maritime disasters, resulting in the tragic loss of over 1,500 lives. Factors like class, gender, and age are well-known to have influenced survival rates. However, this project seeks to uncover hidden patterns within the data by applying k-means clustering, revealing lesser-known demographic groupings and trends that may have impacted survival outcomes.
Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to employ k-means clustering to segment Titanic passengers based on their demographic features and ticket information. This analysis aims to:
Identify hidden clusters of passengers and reveal relationships that may have influenced survival.
Analyze how different factors, such as age, family size, and fare, interact within each cluster.
Visualize these clusters to understand patterns and trends in survival rates.
Provide data-driven insights using visual tools to enhance understanding of the factors contributing to the passengers' fate.
OUTCOMES
The outcome of this project is a comprehensive understanding of the key factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic, derived through k-means clustering analysis. The project revealed several important insights:
Impact of Passenger Class: First-class passengers had a significantly higher survival rate compared to second- and third-class passengers. This highlights the influence of socioeconomic status on survival.
Gender and Age: Women and children had a greater likelihood of survival, emphasizing the "women and children first" evacuation principle that was applied during the disaster.
Family Size Influence: Passengers traveling with smaller family groups tended to have better survival outcomes compared to those traveling with large families.
Data Segmentation Using Clustering: The k-means clustering model successfully segmented the passengers into distinct clusters based on factors such as age, gender, class, and family size. This segmentation provided a deeper understanding of survival patterns.
The project outcome demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning techniques, like k-means clustering, in identifying hidden patterns in historical datasets. These insights are valuable not only for historical analysis but also for informing modern-day safety protocols and decision-making in transportation and emergency planning.
Conclusions
The k-means clustering approach in this project successfully segmented Titanic passengers into distinct groups based on their demographic and ticket information. The analysis revealed key patterns, including the impact of class, gender, and age on survival rates. While women, children, and first-class passengers had a higher likelihood of survival, lower-class passengers, especially men, were more vulnerable.
By applying clustering, we can uncover hidden trends that traditional analysis might overlook. This project demonstrates the value of machine learning techniques in enhancing historical data analysis, offering actionable insights for future policy and safety protocols in mass transportation systems
